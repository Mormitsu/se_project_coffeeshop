# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS. This website was created for a coffee shop in the **Tripple Peaks Library** mainly to keep students cozy and energized within the library.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The website has lots of room for improvement. One of the things that can be implemented would be adding a section for customers to place their orders ahead, this would allow customers to avoid waiting in line and continue their work as soon as posible.
